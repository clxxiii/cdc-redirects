      <ul>
      <li> Players will sign up individually, and be drafted onto teams of four to compete in a <b>2v2 double elimination bracket.</b></li>
      <li> This tournament is for players in the <b>#85,000 - #300,000</b> rank range.</li>
      <li> All players must be within the rank range <b>before the end of the registration period</b>.</li>
      <li> Screening will take place in during the qualifier week. Players can be screened for a variety of reasons, from evidence of cheating, to a previous history of toxicity, to the tournament running better without specific players.</li>
      <li> <b>All players from each team must be in the discord server.</b></li>
      <li> All times posted will be in the <b>UTC Timezone</b>. A clock is available on the main sheet to use if you need it.</li>
      <li> All staff except for <b>Streamers and Commentators</b> are forbidden from participating in the tournament.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1><span class="size150">Qualifiers</span></h1>
      <ul>
      <li> Players will be notified of their match 15 minutes from the start of the match.</li>
      <li> Players will be expected to join on time, but there will be a 5 minute buffer for being late, and a 10 minute buffer if you let the ref know you're going to be late.</li>
      <li> Starting from NM1, players will play each map once in the qualifier pool.</li>
      <li> If a player disconnects, they will have a chance to replay the maps they missed at the end of the lobby.</li>
      <li> After each map has been played, the player's <i>map rating</i> will be calculated using the following formula:</li>
      <img style="border-radius: 25pc;width: 75%;margin: 10px auto;display: block;" src="https://i.imgur.com/vtBKPFe.png"></img>
      <li> Each player's map ratings will be added together to get their final rating, and players will be sorted into tiers for the drafting phase.</li>
      </ul>


      <h1><span class="size150">Drafting</span></h1>
      <ul>
      <li> <b>Using each player's final rating, the top 128 players will be sorted into four tiers.</b><ul>
          <li> The top 32 players will become captains.
          <li> The top 64 players will become <b>Tier 2</b>
          <li> The top 96 players will become <b>Tier 3</b>
          <li> The top 128 players will become <b>Tier 4</b>
          </ul>
      <li> Each captain will be assigned a team with the same name as their qualifier rank. <span class="size85">(eg. Rank 1 = Team 1 etc.)</span>

      <li> Starting with <b>Team 32</b>, the captain of each team will choose a player to join their team from Tier 2.
      <li> Tier 2 picks will go in <b>descending order,</b> starting with Team 32 and ending with Team 1

      <li> After all Tier 2 players have been picked, <b>Team 1</b> takes their choice of a player from Tier 3.
      <li> Tier 3 picks will go in <b>ascending order,</b> starting with Team 1 and ending with Team 32

      <li> After all Tier 3 players have been picked, <b>Team 32</b> takes their choice of a player from Tier 4.
      <li> Tier 4 picks will go in <b>descending order,</b> starting with Team 32 and ending with Team 1

      <li> The draft phase will have been completed, and captains may now rename their team if they so choose.
      </ul>
      <h1><span class="size150">Match Procedure</span></h1>
      <ul>
      <li> Teams will be notified of the match at least 15 minutes before the start of their match. <b>Captains are expected to be responsive to the ping.</b>
      <li> At least two players from each team must be in the lobby by the scheduled match time. <b>After 5 minutes, your team loses their ban(s). After  10 minutes, they will be forfeited.</b>
      <li> Captains will roll before the start of each match. The highest roll gets to choose the order of either picking or banning (pick or ban; first or second). Loser of the roll will order the unchosen one. Depending on what stage the tourney is at, each player will get 1 or 2 bans. Ban order will be 1221.
      <li> Teams may not ban twice from the same modpool (excluding NM) and Teams may not pick from the same modpool twice in a row (excluding NM).
      <li> Each team takes turns picking maps from the pool. The team with the higher score at the end of the map gets a point.
      <li> EZ mod scores will be multiplied by 1.7x
      <li> For Freemod maps, teams are required to have at least 1 player with a mod, including HD, HR, FL or EZ.
      <li> If both players are in match point, the tiebreaker map will be played.
      </ul>
